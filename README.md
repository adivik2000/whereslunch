This is a two-part assignment in conducting design-related code review.

For the first part, you should come up with a list of notes and questions for the reviewers of your project.  These questions will help the students who review your project give you the feedback you need.  You can add these to the notes section on your submission, so that they are displayed in the same place as the comments.

The second part of the project is to review other students projects.  You should study and review at least two other projects (more is OK), answering the questions left by the project maintainer and also sharing any other thoughts you might have about the code.  

You can find projects to comment on by clicking on other students submissions in the course dashboard.  Pick projects that either haven't been reviewed, or have only one other commenter, so that the total amount of reviews get evenly distributed across the projects.

Remember, the focus of this exercise (and this course) is on web development.  Your comments and questions should mainly be about the high level structure of your project, i.e. UX (User Experience), framework choices, etc.  Comments about minor idioms are okay, but should be secondary to high level discussion.

Once you have created a list of questions and notes for your project, and reviewed at least two other projects, you can request a review on your submission to get credit for the assignment.  Include in your comment links to the other submissions you have reviewed.
